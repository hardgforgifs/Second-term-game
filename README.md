Use classpath of module: `game.desktop.main`  

Then select the new configuration, and you will be able to run it.

## Testing (IntelliJ IDEA)

The tests can be run all at once with the gradle task in build.gradle from the tests subproject(tests folder)
Otherwise run 1 by 1, or class by class via the test classes
